# slack-action

Send custom slack messages given a slack block template

## Usage

```yaml
- uses: Brymastr/slack-action@v0.1.0
  name: Slack notification
  env:
    SLACK_WEBHOOK: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
  with:
    template: './template.json'
    exampleKey1: example value 1
    job_status: ${{ job.status }}
```

template.json

```json
{
  "blocks": [
    {
      "type": "section",
      "text": {
        "type": "mrkdwn",
        "text": "Example: {{ exampleKey1 }} and {{ job_status }}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Use of this action requires a GitHub secret called `SLACK_WEBHOOK`. The value should include the channel id and look something like this: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/11111ZZZZ/22222XXXX/1a2B3c4e5F6G7h8I9j0k`

See [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets) for assistance with GitHub Secrets.

See [Sending messages using Incoming Webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) for assistance with Slack Webhooks.

**Required Arguments**

- **`SLACK_WEBHOOK`** - provided as an `env` variable, this is the full webhook url for your bot channel.
- **`template`** - provided in the `with` args, is the path to the message template json file. This path should be relative from the project root.

**Optional Arguments**  
Any other custom arguments can be provided and will be included in the template. From the example above all occurrences of `{{ key1 }}` in the `example-message-template.json` file will be replace with `value 1`.

## Default and Computed Properties

Most `github` context properties are included by default without needing to pass them in through a `with` argument. Some properties have been renamed to make a bit more sense. See [Contexts](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions#contexts) for more info.

| Property Name       | Replacement Variable |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| `github.sha`        | `commit`             |
| `github.repository` | `repo`               |
| `github.ref`        | `ref`                |
| `github.head_ref`   | `head_ref`           |
| `github.base_ref`   | `base_ref`           |
| `github.actor`      | `actor`              |
| `github.event_name` | `event`              |
| `github.workflow`   | `workflow`           |

In addition to these github context properties there are 2 computed properties that could be useful

| Replacement Variable | Description                                               |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `repo_url`           | the URL of the github repo                                |
| `actions_url`        | the URL of the github actions workflow run for the commit |

## Motivation

Slack notifications are a common feature in automated build pipelines. There are already a few existing GitHub Actions that send slack messages but most use a predetermined format and only allow for title or subject customization. This action allows for full block customization. I would like this action to serve as a simple, solid, and customizable slack notification action with as few dependencies as possible.
